Terraform
=========

    Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp. 
    It enables users to define and provision a datacenter infrastructure using a high-level configuration language 
    known as Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL), or optionally JSON.
    Terraform supports a number of cloud infrastructure providers such as Amazon Web Services, 
    IBM Cloud (formerly Bluemix), Google Cloud Platform, DigitalOcean, 
    Linode, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, OVH, Scaleway, VMware vSphere or Open Telekom Cloud 
    as well as OpenNebula and OpenStack

Why not ansible
===============

Personally I would differentiate between cloud resource management and configuration. If you are used to ansible,
you can easily combine both.
